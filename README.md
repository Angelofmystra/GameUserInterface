Known Problems
===============

Pressing enter while the password field is selected doesnt onAction, it simply confirms the password.

The components dont scale to size when the game client is minimised. This would be fine if it didnt scroll. 

Streching the game client form on Ubuntu caused problems with the background image scaling to fit properly.

Mysterious bug that occurs intermittenly where just after login when the game client starts the colour scheme will go all messed up and cryllic lettering will appear. The situation resolves after a moment.
